Create a single-file web page that explains details of survival skills. Include how to obtain water, make fire, shelter, weapons, tools, hunting equipment. Make sure to include how to use a stone knife and how to make fishing gear. Include a section about mental care. Include facts and tips for each section. Expand each section with deep details, pointers and tips. Include icons from https://fonts.google.com/icons. Add a disclaimer and a table of contents at the beginning. Add a relevant story at the end of each chapter. Make the website in the style of a field manual. I would like this html manual to be at least 30 pages long so make it as detailed as possible. Add printing page-breaks after every chapter.
